## Overview

SitDown is a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) project aimed at matching students and remote workers with cafes that suit their work needs. The project leverages a map-based interface for ease of searching, filtering, and booking cafes.

## Project Description

The goal of SitDown is to create a platform that allows users to easily find and book cafes that cater to their work or study preferences. Through a series of usability testing phases, we evaluated both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes to assess effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction.

## Research and Testing

### Context of Use
The **context of use analysis** involved interviews, contextual inquiries, and ethnographic observations with students, remote workers, and cafe managers to understand their preferences and pain points. We found Wi-Fi, seating, and quiet environments to be major decision factors when selecting a cafe for work.

### Low-Fidelity Usability Testing
We created two prototypes: a **Requirements-focused prototype** (focused on individual needs) and a **Socially-focused prototype** (based on friend recommendations). The usability tests indicated a user preference for the map-based design of the Requirements-focused prototype.

### High-Fidelity Usability Testing
The high-fidelity prototype was built using React Native and was tested with 10 participants. Participants performed tasks and completed SUS (System Usability Scale) and UEQ (User Experience Questionnaire) surveys. The testing highlighted good effectiveness but identified areas for visual improvement and usability issues with the filtering options.

## Personas

We developed three main personas based on interviews and observations:

- **Jason**: A student who prefers to study in lively cafes but struggles with space availability.
- **Britney**: A remote worker who requires quiet, reliable cafes for meetings.
- **Ahmed**: A cafe owner who seeks to monetize remote workers while accommodating peak-time customers.

## Key Findings

- **Effectiveness**: The high-fidelity prototype had a task success rate of 90% for Task 1, 80% for Task 2, and 100% for Task 3.
- **Efficiency**: Time taken to complete tasks was higher than expected for Task 1 and Task 2 but improved in Task 3.
- **Satisfaction**: The SUS score was 80, indicating a good overall usability rating, though novelty and visual appeal were identified as areas for improvement.

## Technologies

- **React Native** for app development
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React Navigation** for routing
- **React Native Elements** for UI components
